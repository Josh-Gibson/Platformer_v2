# Platformer_v1
First Platforming game in Java

==BUILDING==

- This was compiled using java 9.0.4
- Make sure you have your java path set
- javac Platform.java (since all the classes are in that one file)
- java Platform

The level system uses separate text files, and modifying them could cause the game to not compile or run right. The can however be edited with different numbers to change level layout.
